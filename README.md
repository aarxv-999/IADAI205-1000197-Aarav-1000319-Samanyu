# AI-Powered Cultural Tourism Recommendation & Itinerary Platform

## Problem Statement
Often, tourists face struggles to plan their trips which are truly aligned with their personal interests, weather preferences, season, accessibility needs as well as budget. Most of the current travel platforms provide generic recommendations that don't consider a lot of parameters and are really fundamental. Resultantly, the traveler ends up spending a lot of unnecessary time researching their destinations just to still receive incomplete and irrelevant suggestions. <br/>

To address this issue, our project aims to build an AI powered Cultural Tourism Insights & Engagement Platform which deliers smart recommendations, personalized itineraries, multilingual explanations, PDF travel summaries, and an AI chatbot assistant. By combining the cleaned tourism datasets with Geminni-powered gen AI, the system can help travelers get accurate, tailoed and culturally rich travel planning support. <br/>

## Objectives

- To give AI-powered personalized tourism recommendations which are based on a user's personal interests, season, weather choices, age groups as well as accessibility needs.
- To generate day-by-day personalized travel itineraries using the cleaned tourism datasets combining them with gen AI.
- To help with multilingual travel assistance by leveraging Gemini to translate the descriptions, itineraries, and travel insights into different languages.
- To create travel itinerary PDFs that can be downloaded by our users for their convenience.
- To generate an AI-powered recap video, which will summarize the choice of destinations with captions and images.
- To collect and analyze the user feedback (likes, dislikes, ratings, chatbot responses, etc.) and use it to improve recommendations and system performance.
